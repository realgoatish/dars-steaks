# World's Best Cheesesteaks

We use only the best quality ribeye: gently shaved to small ribbons, left large enough for the perfect chew, but small enough to allow all your cheese and toppings to penetrate the entire steak.  
  
Here at Dar's Steaks, we know what it takes to make the best cheesesteak.  We don't have just one type of perfectly baked roll...we have *four*.  
  
And have we mentioned the whiz yet?  Our whiz is made in-house with our own special recipe and it tastes *addictive*.
